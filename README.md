🧠 Neural Network Models and Use Cases  
Welcome to the Neural Network Models and Use Cases repository! This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various types of neural networks applied to different real-world tasks. Each notebook provides a detailed walkthrough, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, making it an excellent resource for learning and experimenting with neural networks.

📂 Repository Structure  
Notebooks : `All the notebooks with different types of ANN`  
images_generated: `Every model epoch sumsample of images`  


Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  


Type: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)  


Type: Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)  

Type: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)  `GPU and CPU compared`

Type: BERT  `CPU not possile so GPU`


📊 Evaluation and Metrics
Each notebook not only builds and trains a neural network but also includes comprehensive evaluation metrics:

Accuracy
Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
Confusion Matrices
Visualizations: Includes sample predictions, loss/accuracy plots, and image reconstructions.
