üìÇ Repository Structure
CNN_Image_Classification.ipynb

Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Use Case: Image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Description: This notebook demonstrates how to build a CNN to classify images into 10 different categories. It includes techniques like data augmentation, dropout, and model evaluation metrics.
RNN_Time_Series_Prediction.ipynb

Type: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Use Case: Time series prediction using the Sunspot dataset.
Description: This notebook shows how to use an RNN to predict future values in a time series. It includes data preparation, model design, and performance analysis.
FNN_Binary_Classification.ipynb

Type: Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
Use Case: Binary classification with the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.
Description: A basic example of using a feedforward neural network for binary classification. The notebook covers data normalization, model training, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Autoencoder_Dimensionality_Reduction.ipynb

Type: Autoencoder
Use Case: Dimensionality reduction and data reconstruction using the MNIST dataset.
Description: Learn how to build and train an autoencoder to compress and reconstruct data. This notebook is a great introduction to unsupervised learning with neural networks.
GAN_Image_Generation.ipynb

Type: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
Use Case: Image generation with the CelebA dataset.
Description: This notebook explores how GANs can be used to generate new images. It includes both the generator and discriminator models, training loops, and visualizations of generated images.
